## External Services Used

This plugin relies on third-party services to embed videos and images. Specifically, it uses YouTube and Vimeo for video embedding.

### YouTube Integration
Our plugin allows users to embed YouTube videos by providing a YouTube URL. When a YouTube URL is provided, an iframe is created to embed the video on the page. This means that the video content is hosted by YouTube and not on your own server, which helps in saving bandwidth and storage space. 

**Service Link:** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)

**Terms of Use:** [YouTube Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms)

**Privacy Policy:** [YouTube Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

### Vimeo Integration
Similarly, our plugin allows users to embed Vimeo videos by providing a Vimeo URL. When a Vimeo URL is provided, an iframe is created to embed the video on the page. Vimeo hosts the video content, ensuring that your website's bandwidth and storage are not impacted.

### How the Plugin Interacts with External Services

1. **Embedding YouTube Videos:**
   - Users provide a YouTube URL.
